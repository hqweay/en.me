        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Test</p><p>Only from these figures do they think they have learned anything about him.</p><hr><p>All grown-ups were first children. (But few of them remember it.)</p><hr><p>“But if you do not tie him, he’ll go anywhere, and he’ll get lost.”</p><p>It does not matter, it’s so small, at home!</p><p>And, with a little melancholy, perhaps, he added:Straight ahead you can not go far …</p><hr><p>Big people like the numbers. When you tell them about a new friend, they never question you about the basics. They never tell you, “What is the sound of his voice?” What games does he prefer? Does he collect butterflies? They ask, “How old is he?” How many brothers? How much does he weigh ? How much does his father earn? Then they only think they know him. If you say to the grown-ups: “I saw a beautiful pink brick house, with geraniums on the windows and doves on the roof …” they can not imagine this house. We must say to them: &quot;I have seen a house of one hundred thousand francs. Then they cried: &quot;How pretty it is! &quot;</p><hr><p>Children should be very lenient towards adults.</p><hr><p>unfortunately, I do not know how to see the sheep through the crates. I may be a bit like grown-ups. I must have got older.</p><hr><p>“You know … when you’re so sad you like the sunsets …”<br>“So the day of the forty-four times you were so sad?”<br>But the little prince did not answer.</p><hr><p>“You talk like grown-ups!”</p><hr><p>“You will judge yourself, then,” replied the king. This is the most difficult. It is much more difficult to judge oneself than to judge others. If you manage to judge yourself well, it is because you are a true wise man.</p><hr><p>“I believe that on my planet there is somewhere an old rat. I hear it at night. You can judge that old rat. You will condemn him to death from time to time. So his life will depend on your righteousness. But you will pardon it every time to save it. There is only one.”</p><hr><p>“Why do you drink?” Asked the little prince.<br>“To forget,” replied the drinker.</p><p>To forget what? Inquired the little prince, who already pitied him.<br>“To forget that I am ashamed,” confessed the drinker, lowering his head.</p><hr><p>“Where are the men ? Resumed the little prince. We’re a little alone in the desert …”<br>“One is also alone among men,” said the serpent.</p><hr><p>“Of course,” said the fox. You are but a little boy to me, like a hundred thousand little boys. And I do not need you. And you do not need me either. I am only a fox to you like a hundred thousand foxes. But if you tame me, we will need one another. You will be unique in the world for me. I will be for you unique in the world …<br>“I begin to understand,” said the little prince. There is a flower … I think she tamed me …</p><hr><p>&quot;My life is monotonous. I chase chickens, men chase me. All the chickens resemble each other, and all men are alike. So I’m a little bored. But if you tame me, my life will be as sunny. I will experience a footstep that will be different from all the others. The other steps make me go underground. Yours will call me out of the burrow, like a music. And look! You see, over there, the fields of wheat? I do not eat bread. Wheat for me is useless. The wheat fields do not remind me of anything. And that’s sad! But you have golden hair. Then it will be wonderful when you have tamed me! The wheat, which is gilded, will make me remember you. And I will love the sound of the wind in wheat … &quot;</p><hr><p>“You must be very patient,” replied the fox. You will sit first a little far from me, like that, in the grass. I will look at you from the corner of your eye and you will not say anything. Language is a source of misunderstanding. But every day you can sit a little closer … &quot;</p><hr><p>“It would have been better to return at the same hour,” said the fox. If you come, for example, at four o’clock in the afternoon, at three o’clock I shall begin to be happy. The more time will come, the more happy I will feel. At four o’clock I shall be agitated and worried; I shall discover the price of happiness! But if you come anytime, I will never know what time to dress my heart … it takes rites.</p><hr><p>“What is a rite?” Said the little prince.<br>“It’s too much forgotten,” said the fox. This is what makes one day different from other days, one hour, other hours. There is a rite, for example, among my hunters. They dance on Thursday with the girls of the village. Then Thursday is a wonderful day! I’ll walk up the vineyard. If the hunters danced at any time, the days would all be alike, and I would have no holiday. &quot;</p><hr><p>“I win,” said the fox, “because of the color of the corn.”</p><hr><p>“Good-bye,” said the fox. Here is my secret. It is very simple: one sees only with the heart. What is essential is invisible to the eye.<br>“The essential thing is invisible to the eyes,” repeated the little prince, in order to remember.</p><hr><p>“Children alone know what they are looking for,” said the little prince. They lose time for a rag doll, and it becomes very important, and if they are taken away, they cry …<br>“They’re lucky,” said the switchman.</p><hr><p>He was tired. He sat. I sat down beside him. And after a pause he said,“The stars are beautiful, because of a flower that one does not see …”</p>]]></content>
